    "text": "Step-by-step user guide for forest simulation with the C++ executable\n\nSystem requirements?\n\n\nInstallation process?\n\n\nUsage\n3-PG is a command line program, and its behaviour is controlled by several command line options, specified in unix style. The C++ implementation of 3-PG is heavily influenced by the original Excel version, enabling users to easily switch between either implementation (more on the Excel version can be found in Section 5).\nThe usage of the program is:\n3pg -d default_file -s site_file\n3-PG reads input parameters from two text files. The parameters are named to match the parameter names used in the Excel version. While the two parameter files are referred to as the ‘default’ and the ‘site’ parameter files, there is virtually no difference in the possible content of the files. Two files are allowed simply as a convenience, and to be similar to the structure of the Excel version. Example parameter files are provided as part of Section 4.\n\n\nParameter Files\nThe format of the parameter file is, in general, one parameter per line, with the parameter name being enclosed in double quotes, and white space seperating the parameter name and its value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nComments are allowed in the parameter file. Comments can appear almost anywhere, must begin with two forward slash characters ‘//’, and end at the end of the line.\n\n\nSite Parameter File\nThe site parameter file includes two types of parameters. Site characteristics, and climate parameters, which are referred to as ‘series’ parameters. The site parameter file typically contains the following parameters:\n// Site and Stand Descriptors\nLatitude (Latitude)\nSoil fertility (Fertility rating)\nSoil texture (Soil class)\nMaximum available soil water (Maximum ASW)\nMinimum available soil water (Minimum ASW)\nStart age of the trees (Start age)\nEnd year of the simulation (End year)\nStart month of the simulation (Start month)\nYear the stand was planted (Year Planted)\nInitial foliage biomass (WFi)\nInitial root biomass (WRi)\nInitial stem biomass (WSi)\nInitial stem number (StemNoi)\nInitial available soil water (ASWi)\n\n// Climate Parameters\nMonthly means of maximum daily temperature (Tmax)\nMonthly means of minimum daily temperature (Tmax)\nMonthly mean rainfall (Rain)\nMonthly mean short-wave radiation (Solar radtn)\nFrost days per month (Frost)\nParameters that describe site conditions can be prodided as constants, or rasters.\nFor example:\n\"Fertility rating\",  0.7\nor\n\"Fertility rating\",  fert.tif\nIn the first case, fertility would be set to a constant value of 25. In the second case, a raster is used to set the fertility value across an area of interest.\nClimate parameters are formatted slightly differently. While they can still be provided as a constant or as a raster, one value or raster needs to be provided per month. These values can be regarded as being for an average year. In model runs of more than 1 year these values will be used repeatedly. In this format a series parameter takes the form of a climate keyword, followed by whitespace, followed by 12 values. For example, this line:\n\"frost days\" fr01.tif fr02.tif 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nsets the value of frost days to be zero for all months of the year, except January, February, and March. In January and February, the value of frost days will be obtained from a raster, which allows the values of frost days to vary spatially for those two months.\nThe second format for series parameters allows for climate values to be associated with particular years, and for more than one year of input. In this format the keyword must be on a line by itself, followed lines containing a year, followed by 12 values. The series must be terminated by a blank line. For example:\n\"Rain\" \n1996 0 0 0 0 0 0 ppt9607.tif ppt9608.tif ppt9609.tif ppt9610.tif 50 50 \n1997 75 ppt9702.tif ppt9703.tif 150 ppt9705.tif ppt9706.tif 0 0 0 0 0 0\nThis gives constant zero values to precipitation for the first 6 months of 1996, raster values for July to October, constant values for November to January, raster values for February and March, a constant value for April, and raster values for May and June.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe parameter “output directory” gives the path to a directory in which output rasters will be written.\n\n\nManagement Tables\n3-PG can make use of “management tables”. These tables allow arbitrary changes to be made to some of the model variables at particular points in time, simulating the effect of management actions. Three management tables are recognised, allowing control of model variables representing fertility (FR), irrigation (Irrig) and minimum available soil water (MinASW).\nManagement tables in the C++ version of 3-PG are completely analagous to those in the Excel version, with the one difference that the C++ version requires management tables to be listed in calendar years (the Excel version requires tables listed by stand age).\nManagement tables are indicated in the parameter file by one of the three keyword phrases: “Management: fertility”, “Management: Irrigation”, or “Management: MinASW”. The keyphrase must appear on a line on its own, followed on subsequent lines by the calendar year, and the value of the management variable. Each value can be either a grid file or a constant. For example:\n  \"Management: irrigation\"\n    1994  8\n    1997  irr1997.tif\n    2000  0\nIn the example above, if we assume that the “year planted” parameter has the value 1989, then for every year up to, but not including, 1994, 8 ML/year of irrigation is applied, over the whole run area. For the years 1994, 1995 and 1996, each cell will receive the irrigation specified in the grid file irr1997.tif. If a cell contains the NODATA value, the effect of the previous entry in the management table persists. For the years 1998 and on, zero irrigation is applied throughout the whole run area. This carry over of the last entry of the management table duplicates the working of the Excel version.\nThe irrigation management variable can only be provided with a management table. MinASW and fertility, however, can be provided both as management tables and as ordinary parameters. In this case the ordinary parameter value will take effect only where the management table does not provide a value, such as a cell which has the value NODATA in every entry in the management table.\nSpecies Parameter File\nAs mention in the previous section, 3-PG requires a specific species parameter file, which is provided separately to the site parameter file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nExample parameter files are provided in Section 7",

    "text": "How does 3-PG Work?\n3-PG consists of five submodules: biomass production, biomass allocation, stem mortality, soil water balance, and stand management. Together, these submodules dictate how much stand can grow over a given period of time.\n\nPhotosynthetically active radiation (APAR) absorbed by the canopy is determined from total solar radiation, and canopy LAI. Environmental modifiers, based on atmospheric vapour pressure deficit, available soil water, mean air temperature, frost days per month, site nutrition, and stand age are then taken into account, limiting the total gross primary production that can occur. Net primary production (NPP) is a constant fraction of GPP (47%).\nAllocation of NPP (biomass) to stems and foliage varies by growing conditions, and depends on average tree size; allocation to foliage declines and that to stems increases as stands age. Allocation of NPP to roots depends on growing conditions (expressed by available soil water, vapour pressure deficit, and site nutrition). The proportion of NPP allocated to roots increases when nutritional status and/or available soil water are low.\nAn upper limit of stem number is calculated based on the single-tree stem mass of a current stem population. If the current stem mass is greater than the upper limit, the stem population is reduced to a level consistent with this limit.\nFinally, stand characteristics that are of interest to scientists and forests managers such as biomass, stem volume, basal area, and mean stem diameter can be calculated for the entire duration of stand growth.",

The log file will be called “logfile.txt”, and will be written to the directory specified by the parameter “output path”, or the current directory should this parameter not be found.\n\n\nOutputs\nThe outputs available from 3PG depend on whether it is being used in point or grid mode, and in standard or satellite mode.\nIn point mode, the parameter “output file” is required, and gives the name of an output file. All available output variables will be logged in this file. In standard mode a large set of variables will be logged on a one year timestep. In satellite mode 4 variables will be logged on a monthly timestep.\nIn grid mode, the parameter “output directory” gives a path to a directory in which output grid files will be written. The output variables are selected and named as demonstrated in the example file. In standard mode 9 variables are available for output, and are listed in the example file example2.txt. In satellite mode only 4 variables are available for output, and are listed in the example file example3.txt.\nIn grid and standard mode the output variables are written at the end of the model run. Grids of intermediate values can also be written, by placing a start year and recurrence interval after the output grid parameter. For example:\n“Weight of stems” wstem.flt 1975 1 month 1\nwill cause the variable “weight of stems” to be written yearly on the first month of every year from 1975. The optional start year and interval will cause intermediate values of the “weight of stems” variable to be saved to grid files called wstem197501.flt, wstem198001.flt, etc. Using the keyword “monthly”:\n“Weight of stems” wstem.flt 1975 1 monthly\nWill produce grids every month from 1975.\nThe full list of output variables available in standard 3PG and spatial modes is:\nshort name     long name\n--------------------------------------\n\"StemNo\"       \"Stocking density\"\n\"WF\"           \"Weight of foliage\"\n\"WR\"           \"Weight of roots\"\n\"WS\"           \"Weight of stems\"\n\"TotalW\"       \"Total weight\"\n\"MAI\"          \"Mean Annual Increment\"\n\"avDBH\"        \"Average DBH\"\n\"BasArea\"      \"Basal Area\"\n\"StandVol\"     \"Stand volume\"\n\"Transp\"       \"Transpiration\"\n\"ASW\"          \"Available Soil Water\"\n\"fSW\"        \"Soil water modifier\"\n\"fVPD\"         \"VPD modifier\"\n\"evaporation\"  \"Canopy Evaporation\"\n\"LAIx\"       \"Maximum Leaf Area Index\"\n\"ageLAIx\"    \"Age at Maximum Leaf Area\"\n\"LAI\"          \"Leaf Area Index\"\nThe full list of output variables available in 3PGS and spatial modes is:\nshort name     long name\n--------------------------------------\n\"NPP\"          \"Net Primary Production (tDM/ha)\"\n\"delWAG\"       \"change in aboveground biomass (tDM/ha)\"\n\"cumWabv\"      \"accumulated aboveground biomass (tDM/ha)\"\n\"LAI\"          \"Leaf Area Index\"",
