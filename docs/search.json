    "text": "📜 The Log file\n3-PG writes a log file, which contains some details of the progress of the model, and is particularly useful for finding problems in the parameter files. The log file will be called “logfile.txt”, and will be written to the directory specified by the parameter “output path”, or the current directory should this parameter not be found.\n\n\n🗺️ Outputs\nThe parameter “output directory” gives a path to a directory in which output raster files will be written. The output variables are selected and named as demonstrated in the example site file in the Additional Resources and Examples section. Output variables are written at the end of the model run, although intermediate values can also be written. This is done by placing a start year and recurrence interval after the output grid parameter. For example:\n\"Weight of stems\" wstem.tif 1975 1 month 1\nWill cause the variable “weight of stems” to be written yearly on the first month of every year from 1975. The optional start year and interval will cause intermediate values of the “weight of stems” variable to be saved to raster files called wstem197501.tif, wstem198001.tif, etc. Using the keyword “monthly”:\n\"Weight of stems\" wstem.tif 1975 1 monthly\nWill produce grids every month from 1975 until the end of the run.\nThe full list of output variables available in 3-PG is:\nshort name     long name\n--------------------------------------\n\"StemNo\"       \"Stocking density\"\n\"WF\"           \"Weight of foliage\"\n\"WR\"           \"Weight of roots\"\n\"WS\"           \"Weight of stems\"\n\"TotalW\"       \"Total weight\"\n\"MAI\"          \"Mean Annual Increment\"\n\"avDBH\"        \"Average DBH\"\n\"BasArea\"      \"Basal Area\"\n\"StandVol\"     \"Stand volume\"\n\"Transp\"       \"Transpiration\"\n\"ASW\"          \"Available Soil Water\"\n\"fSW\"        \"Soil water modifier\"\n\"fVPD\"         \"VPD modifier\"\n\"evaporation\"  \"Canopy Evaporation\"\n\"LAIx\"       \"Maximum Leaf Area Index\"\n\"ageLAIx\"    \"Age at Maximum Leaf Area\"\n\"LAI\"          \"Leaf Area Index\"\n\"NPP\"          \"Net Primary Production (tDM/ha)\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen providing output variables, both the short name and long name are recognized in the parameter files.",

    "text": "3-PG (Physiological Principles Predicting Growth) is a process-based model designed to simulate forest growth and productivity. It was developed by Landsberg and Waring in 19971, and then modified and used in a spatial version by Coops et al., 19982. The model represents a significant advancement in forest modeling by bridging the gap between conventional empirical models and complex process-based models. 3-PG is a generic stand model that runs on a monthly time step using climate data, and can be parameterized for individual species. 3-PG consists of five submodules: assimilation of carbohydrates, the distribution of biomass between foliage, roots and stems, the determination of stem number, soil water balance, and conversion of biomass into variables of interest to forest managers.\nKey features of 3-PG include:\n\nSimplicity: 3-PG uses a small number of parameters that are readily available or easily estimated.\nMonthly time-step: Allows for detailed analysis of seasonal variations in growth.\nGenerality: Can be applied to a wide range of forest types and management regimes.\nPhysiological basis: Incorporates key physiological processes governing tree growth.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Step-by-step user guide for forest simulation with the C++ executable.\n\n💻 System requirements?\nThe 3-PG executable can be run on Windows (still need to test Mac and/or Linux). The main limitation of 3-PG is the size of the input files - minimum system requirements can be highlighted here, or we can send readers to Technical Details.\n\n\n⚙️ Installation process\nTo use the executable, copy and paste it to your desired location. After that, all you need is the file path to paste into the command line.\n\n\n✍️ Usage\n3-PG is a command line program, and its behaviour is controlled by several command line options, specified in unix style. The C++ implementation of 3-PG is heavily influenced by the original Excel version, enabling users to easily switch between either implementation (more on the Excel version can be found in Other Implementations).\nThe usage of the program is:\n'path to 3-PG.exe' -d 'path to site file' -s 'path to site file'\n3-PG reads input parameters from two text files. The parameters are named to match the parameter names used in the Excel version. While the two parameter files are referred to as the ‘species’ (or ‘default’) and ‘site’ parameter files, there is virtually no difference in the possible content of the files. Two files are allowed simply as a convenience, and to be similar to the structure of the Excel version. Example parameter files are provided as part of Additional Resources and Examples.\n\n\n📄 Parameter Files\nThe format of the parameter file is one parameter per line, with the parameter name being enclosed in double quotes, and white space separating the parameter name and its value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nComments are allowed in the parameter file. Comments can appear almost anywhere, must begin with two forward slash characters ‘//’, and end at the end of the line.\n\n\nSite Parameter File\nThe site parameter file includes two types of parameters. Site characteristics, and climate parameters, which are referred to as ‘series’ parameters. The site parameter file typically contains the following parameters:\n// Site and Stand Descriptors\nLatitude (Latitude)\nSoil fertility (Fertility rating)\nSoil texture (Soil class)\nMaximum available soil water (Maximum ASW)\nMinimum available soil water (Minimum ASW, usually set to 0)\nStart age of the trees (Start age)\nEnd year of the simulation (End year)\nStart month of the simulation (Start month)\nYear the stand was planted (Year Planted)\nInitial foliage biomass (WFi)\nInitial root biomass (WRi)\nInitial stem biomass (WSi)\nInitial stem number (StemNoi)\nInitial available soil water (ASWi)\n\n// Climate Parameters\nMonthly means of maximum daily temperature (Tmax)\nMonthly means of minimum daily temperature (Tmax)\nMonthly mean rainfall (Rain)\nMonthly mean short-wave radiation (Solar radtn)\nFrost days per month (Frost)\nParameters that describe site conditions can be provided as constants, or rasters.\nFor example:\n\"Fertility rating\",  0.7\nor\n\"Fertility rating\",  fert.tif\nIn the first case, fertility would be set to a constant value of 0.7. In the second case, a raster is used to set the fertility value across an area of interest.\nClimate parameters are formatted slightly differently. While they can still be provided as a constant or as a raster, one value or raster needs to be provided per month. These values can be regarded as being for an average year. In model runs of more than 1 year these values will be used repeatedly. In this format a series parameter takes the form of a climate keyword, followed by white space, followed by 12 values. For example, this line:\n\"frost days\" fr01.tif fr02.tif 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nSets the value of frost days to be zero for all months of the year, except January, February, and March. In January and February, the value of frost days will be obtained from a raster, which allows the values of frost days to vary spatially for those two months.\nThe second format for series parameters allows for climate values to be associated with particular years, and for more than one year of input. In this format the keyword must be on a line by itself, followed lines containing a year, followed by 12 values. The series must be terminated by a blank line. For example:\n\"Rain\" \n1996 0 0 0 0 0 0 ppt9607.tif ppt9608.tif ppt9609.tif ppt9610.tif 50 50 \n1997 75 ppt9702.tif ppt9703.tif 150 ppt9705.tif ppt9706.tif 0 0 0 0 0 0\nThis gives constant zero values to precipitation for the first 6 months of 1996, raster values for July to October, constant values for November to January, raster values for February and March, a constant value for April, and raster values for May and June.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMake sure to check the formatting of your parameter files! While key words are not case sensitive, any misspellings, incorrect paths, or errant commas can lead to 3-PG failing.\n\n\nManagement Tables\n3-PG can make use of “management tables”. These tables allow arbitrary changes to be made to some of the model variables at particular points in time, simulating the effect of management actions. Three management tables are recognised, allowing control of model variables representing fertility (FR), irrigation (Irrig) and minimum available soil water (MinASW).\nManagement tables in the C++ version of 3-PG are completely analagous to those in the Excel version, with the one difference that the C++ version requires management tables to be listed in calendar years (the Excel version requires tables listed by stand age).\nManagement tables are indicated in the parameter file by one of the three keyword phrases: “Management: fertility”, “Management: Irrigation”, or “Management: MinASW”. The keyphrase must appear on a line on its own, followed on subsequent lines by the calendar year, and the value of the management variable. Each value can be either a grid file or a constant. For example:\n  \"Management: irrigation\"\n    1994  8\n    1997  irr1997.tif\n    2000  0\nIn the example above, if we assume that the “year planted” parameter has the value 1989, then for every year up to, but not including, 1994, 8 ML/year of irrigation is applied, over the whole run area. For the years 1994, 1995 and 1996, each cell will receive the irrigation specified in the grid file irr1997.tif. If a cell contains the NODATA value, the effect of the previous entry in the management table persists. For the years 1998 and on, zero irrigation is applied throughout the whole run area. This carry over of the last entry of the management table duplicates the working of the Excel version.\nThe irrigation management variable can only be provided with a management table. MinASW and fertility, however, can be provided both as management tables and as ordinary parameters. In this case the ordinary parameter value will take effect only where the management table does not provide a value, such as a cell which has the value NODATA in every entry in the management table.\nOther Requirements\nThe parameters “Model mode” and “Output directory” are required, and usually appear at the top of the site parameter file. “Model mode” should be given as ‘3PG’, while “Output directory” gives the path to a directory in which output rasters will be written. For example:\n\"Model mode\" 3PG\n\"Output directory\" D:\\3-PGS_MODEL\nTells the executable to run 3PG and write all output files to a folder called “D:\\3-PGS_MODEL”.\nSpecies Parameter File\nAs mentioned in the previous section, 3-PG requires a specific species parameter file, which is provided separately to the site parameter file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nExample parameter files and how they are used are provided in the Additional Resources and Examples section.",
