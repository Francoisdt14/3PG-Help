3-PG requires climatic data, data describing the physical properties of the site, and a species specific parameter file.

### Site Characteristics

Site factors required include: latitude (ยบ), maximum available water stored in the soil (mm), and oil fertility rating. In addition, initial conditions such as stem, root, and foliage biomass, stocking, and soil water at some time are needed.

### Climate Data

The following climate data is required for 3-PG to run: monthly maximum and minimum temperature (ยบC), monthly mean daily solar radiation (MJ m^-2^ d^-1^), precipitation (mm month^-1^), and frost days.

Climate data can be found from a variety of sources.. **example**

### Species Parameters

Parameters characterising the species of interest is required for 3-PG. Species parameterizations for often exist for common commercial species such as **examples**
