title: "The C++ Executable"

Step-by-step user guide for forest simulation with the C++ executable.

### üíª System requirements?

The 3-PG executable can be run on Windows (still need to test Mac and/or Linux). And minimum system requirements can be highlighted here, or we can send readers to [Technical Details](./Section_8.qmd).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation process

To use the executable, copy and paste it to your desired location. After that, all you need is the file path.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Usage

3-PG is a command line program, and its behaviour is controlled by several command line options, specified in unix style. The C++ implementation of 3-PG is heavily influenced by the original Excel version, enabling users to easily switch between either implementation (more on the Excel version can be found in [Other Implementations](./Section_5.qmd)).

The usage of the program is:

```         
3PG -d default_file -s site_file
```

3-PG reads input parameters from two text files. The parameters are named to match the parameter names used in the Excel version. While the two parameter files are referred to as the 'default' and the 'site' parameter files, there is virtually no difference in the possible content of the files. Two files are allowed simply as a convenience, and to be similar to the structure of the Excel version. Example parameter files are provided as part of [Additional Resources and Examples](./Section_7.qmd).

### üìÑ Parameter Files

The format of the parameter file is, in general, one parameter per line, with the parameter name being enclosed in double quotes, and white space seperating the parameter name and its value.

::: callout-note
Comments are allowed in the parameter file. Comments can appear almost anywhere, must begin with two forward slash characters '//', and end at the end of the line.

**Site Parameter File**

The site parameter file includes two types of parameters. Site characteristics, and climate parameters, which are referred to as 'series' parameters. The site parameter file typically contains the following parameters:

``` {.custom-block style="background-color: #f0f0f0; color: black;"}
// Site and Stand Descriptors
Latitude (Latitude)
Soil fertility (Fertility rating)
Soil texture (Soil class)
Maximum available soil water (Maximum ASW)
Minimum available soil water (Minimum ASW)
Start age of the trees (Start age)
End year of the simulation (End year)
Start month of the simulation (Start month)
Year the stand was planted (Year Planted)
Initial foliage biomass (WFi)
Initial root biomass (WRi)
Initial stem biomass (WSi)
Initial stem number (StemNoi)
Initial available soil water (ASWi)

// Climate Parameters
Monthly means of maximum daily temperature (Tmax)
Monthly means of minimum daily temperature (Tmax)
Monthly mean rainfall (Rain)
Monthly mean short-wave radiation (Solar radtn)
Frost days per month (Frost)
```

Parameters that describe site conditions can be prodided as constants, or rasters.

For example:

```         
"Fertility rating",  0.7
```

or

```         
"Fertility rating",  fert.tif
```

In the first case, fertility would be set to a constant value of 0.7. In the second case, a raster is used to set the fertility value across an area of interest.

Climate parameters are formatted slightly differently. While they can still be provided as a constant or as a raster, one value or raster needs to be provided per month. These values can be regarded as being for an average year. In model runs of more than 1 year these values will be used repeatedly. In this format a series parameter takes the form of a climate keyword, followed by white space, followed by 12 values. For example, this line:

```         
"frost days" fr01.tif fr02.tif 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

sets the value of frost days to be zero for all months of the year, except January, February, and March. In January and February, the value of frost days will be obtained from a raster, which allows the values of frost days to vary spatially for those two months.

The second format for series parameters allows for climate values to be associated with particular years, and for more than one year of input. In this format the keyword must be on a line by itself, followed lines containing a year, followed by 12 values. The series must be terminated by a blank line. For example:

```         
"Rain" 
1996 0 0 0 0 0 0 ppt9607.tif ppt9608.tif ppt9609.tif ppt9610.tif 50 50 
1997 75 ppt9702.tif ppt9703.tif 150 ppt9705.tif ppt9706.tif 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

This gives constant zero values to precipitation for the first 6 months of 1996, raster values for July to October, constant values for November to January, raster values for February and March, a constant value for April, and raster values for May and June.

Make sure to check the formatting of your parameter files! Any misspellings or errant commas can lead to 3-PG failing.

**Management Tables**

3-PG can make use of "management tables". These tables allow arbitrary changes to be made to some of the model variables at particular points in time, simulating the effect of management actions. Three management tables are recognised, allowing control of model variables representing fertility (FR), irrigation (Irrig) and minimum available soil water (MinASW).

Management tables in the C++ version of 3-PG are completely analagous to those in the Excel version, with the one difference that the C++ version requires management tables to be listed in calendar years (the Excel version requires tables listed by stand age).

Management tables are indicated in the parameter file by one of the three keyword phrases: "Management: fertility", "Management: Irrigation", or "Management: MinASW". The keyphrase must appear on a line on its own, followed on subsequent lines by the calendar year, and the value of the management variable. Each value can be either a grid file or a constant. For example:

``` {.custom-block style="background-color: #f0f0f0; color: black;"}
  "Management: irrigation"
    1994  8
    1997  irr1997.tif
    2000  0
```

In the example above, if we assume that the "year planted" parameter has the value 1989, then for every year up to, but not including, 1994, 8 ML/year of irrigation is applied, over the whole run area. For the years 1994, 1995 and 1996, each cell will receive the irrigation specified in the grid file irr1997.tif. If a cell contains the NODATA value, the effect of the previous entry in the management table persists. For the years 1998 and on, zero irrigation is applied throughout the whole run area. This carry over of the last entry of the management table duplicates the working of the Excel version.

The irrigation management variable can only be provided with a management table. MinASW and fertility, however, can be provided both as management tables and as ordinary parameters. In this case the ordinary parameter value will take effect only where the management table does not provide a value, such as a cell which has the value NODATA in every entry in the management table.

Finally, the parameters "Model mode" and "Output directory" are required, and should appear at the top of the site parameter file. "Model mode" can be given as '3PG' for standard usage, and '3PGS' for satellite mode. Output directory" gives the path to a directory in which output rasters will be written. For example:

```         
"Model mode" 3PG
"Output directory" D:\3-PGS_MODEL
```

Would use the standard mode of 3PG and write all output files to the "D:\\3-PGS_MODEL" folder.

**Species Parameter File**

As mentioned in the previous section, 3-PG requires a specific species parameter file, which is provided separately to the site parameter file.
