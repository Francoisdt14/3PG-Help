## Welcome!

Welcome to the home page of the 3-PG User Guide, created by the [Integrated Remote Sensing Studio](https://irsslab.forestry.ubc.ca/) in collaboration with BP. This website includes some background on 3-PG, as well as how to use the 3-PG executable. Topics can be explored by using the panel on the left hand side of the page, or clicking the headings directly. Click the 3-PG logo at any time to return to the home page.
